<p>
  Welcome to my blog. I might put some text for you to pass through your
  eyeballs in the future. I'm not the best writer, but I'll try to make it worth
  your brain-strain to parse my ramblings.
</p>

<p>
  Might contain trace elements of a lot of rants and vents of frustration,
  written by none other than me, the great <b>_pi_</b>, ruler of the underworld
  of cursed technology, broken IT and Austrian cuisine.
</p>

<p>
  Some stuff I write here might be exaggerated for comedic^Wdramatic effect. The
  above is 100% true though. Trust me, I have a degree in Celsius.
